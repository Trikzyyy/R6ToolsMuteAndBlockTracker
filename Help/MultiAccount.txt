This .txt will explain you how to configure the app when you use different account.

At first, configure the Profiles.JSON normaly, like explained in README

Then, go to Profiles/MultiAccount.JSON.

Enter the number you want to use of account in "number_account", max 10 (default value is 1 and when it's 1, it only use the account in Profiles.JSON)

Then, enter the mail and password (in the mdp case) (mdp mean password in french and i'm bored to change it for every time i use it)

The name case is only for you, it will show you this name when you start this app and have to choose the account you want to.
You can put name like "Main" and "Smurf" if you want.

HOW IT WORK : 
When you start the app, instead of instantly connecting to an account, it show you a page with the name of all the account you entered (make sure to put the right number of acc)
Each account are link with a number, press this number to connect to the account
I recommend to use the keyboard number and not the numeric keypad (didn't tryed since it's not on my french keyboard but it might bug with numeric keypad) 

If you see any bug, or you don't manage to configure this > contact Twitter : @TrikzyR6
